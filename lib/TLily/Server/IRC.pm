=head1 NAME

TLily::Server::IRC - TLily interface to IRC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use TLily::Server::IRC;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class interfaces tlily to an IRC server.  It also provides a set of 
/commands for use with IRC messenging.

Note:  For compatibility, this is subclassed from SLCP, and all the state
database-related code is left unmolested.   Ideally though, this code
should be refactored into the base class and SLCP and IRC should sit 
side by side, since IRC is not REALLY a subclass of SLCP.

=item cmd_process()

Execute a lily-like command on an IRC server, and process the output
through a passed-in callback.

Args:
    --  "lily" command to execute
    --  callback to process the output of the command

Used to custom-process the output of a "lily" command.  It will execute
the passed command, and call the callback given for each line returned
by the lily server.  The lines are passed into the callback as TLily
events.
