=head1 NAME

TLily::Server::IRC - TLily interface to IRC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use TLily::Server::IRC;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class interfaces tlily to an IRC server.  It also provides a set of 
/commands for use with IRC messenging.

Note:  For compatibility, this is subclassed from SLCP, and all the state
database-related code is left unmolested.   Ideally though, this code
should be refactored into the base class and SLCP and IRC should sit 
side by side, since IRC is not REALLY a subclass of SLCP.

=for comment

Since lily-style sends can be very verbose, we make a small effort to
collapse multiple sends that occcur in a a brief span of time into
a single user visible send.

Right now, we do this by stripping off the first line of the followup
messages.  Ideally, we should allow the user to specify a "first send" 
and "followup send" format which would each be applied as necessary.
Users should also be able to specify the throttle speed at which a new
send (and, in most cases, a new *timestamp* is therefore used.

This could potentially be turned on with an option for other server
types. There is some pushback to enabling this by default everywhere,
and to be honest, the type of sends one sees on IRC more commonly *need*
this sort of collapse, while lily does not, to the same degree.

Because of the limited use of IRC support, however, we can pretty much
do whatever we want to IRC sends. Muahahah. 

If this does become a generic server thing, move it to a more appropriate
location.
