If you want to run the command line version, you just need to follow the
directions on the RPI server in

/memo osx tlilyonPanther

To build the aqua version, you'll need the developer tools installed. Open
aqua/Tigerlily.pbproj, then build. You'll get a Tigerlily.App that you can just
copy onto your hard drive. (Though there's presumably a better way to do that. =-)

You'll also need the camelbones framework (v2) available from sourceforge.

NOTE:

the aqua client is not fully functional. There's a bunch of stuff that doesn't
work, and needs intrepid folk to fix. At this point, it's slightly more usable
than telnet (but MUCH prettier.)
