Version 2.5.1-post

Version 2.5.1
  * [TLily/Server.pm, TLily/Config.pm] Merge in Phreaker's SLCP SSL patches;
    activate with -secure on commandline, or by setting $secure in your
    config. [MJR]
  * [extensions/server.pl, TLily/Server/IRC.pm] Modify to all specifying
    a server port, and (untested) SSL support, by using 'ircs:' instead of
    'irc:' in the server specifier.  Also modify the /join command to
    allow for channel passwords. [MJR]
  * [tools/tlily_build] TLily::Event uses TLily::Version, but came before 
    TLily::Version in the single-file build.  Moved TLily::Version to be
    the first module in the single-file build. [MJR]
  * [TLily/Server/IRC.pm, TLily/Server/IRC/Driver.pm] Reworked IRC support
    by subclassing Net::IRC as TLily::Server::IRC::Driver, overriding addfh()
    and removefh() so we can use TLily's event loop.  This is incomplete,
    however, as it current only covers io events, and not timed events.
    The latter is TBD. [MJR]
  * [tlily.global] Add a comment about $noauto config variable. [MJR]
  * [TLily/Server/IRC.pm] New module for IRC support. [WJC]
  * [extensions/cj.pl] Many new CJ commands, some code cleanup [WJC]
  * [TLily/ExoSafe.pm,TLily/Extend.pm] Fix bug #1119 - Loading non-
    existant extensions in single-file failed ungracefully.
  * Rework internal POD help system system to work to use new file access
    layer, and uses Pod::Text instead of backticking to perldoc, so it now
    works in Windows and in single-file installs. [MJR]
  * Add a simple file-access layer to ExoSafe that allows for TLily to
    access the contents of component files whether it's normal or single-
    file install. [MJR]
  * [tools/build_tlily] Fix curses single-build build (Was still trying
    to include removed Curses modules. [MJR]
  * Finally removed the Curses UI, as Josh requested [WJC]
  * [extensions/defiance.pl] A bot extension for handling Defiance Radio [JDW]
  * [extensions/deblurb.pl] Fixed handling of blurb changes [RBJ]
  * [extensions/profane.pl] Add extension to convert someone's sends into
    obscenities. [RBJ] 
  * [extensions/deblurb.pl] Add extension to remove blurbs from a given user's
    public, private, and SLCP events. [RBJ]
  * [extensions/slcp_output.pl] Add $stampseconds geekknob to allow the user
    to display timestamps with seconds. [RBJ]
  * [aqua/] Moved all OSX build items into aqua from root. [WJC]

Version 2.4
  * [Makefile.PL] Revamped build system.
  * [extensions/infobot.pl] Tlily-based infobot [JDW]
  * [extensions/group.pl] Reformat group info [WJC]
  * [extensions/dontcare.pl] New extension to chop a given user's sends
    if they exceed a certain length.
  * [extensions/mask.pl] Mask a user to a group name; useful for people
    who change pseodos frequently. [WJC]
  * [extensions/osxspeak.pl] OS/X analog of win32speak.pl [WJC]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses] Added "intelligent" input history browsing, allowing
    to move line-by-line within a multi-line send. [DPN]
  * [TLily/Server/SLCP.pm] Fixed expansion problems when a user /renames
    from a name similar to a discussion name. [SMC]
  * [TLily/Server/SLCP.pm,extension/slcp_state.pl] Tigerlily now notices
    discussion destruction, and removes their names from its database. [SMC]
  * [TLily/Server/SLCP.pm] Added support for '~' to match only users. [SMC]
  * [extensions/keepalive.pl] When re-connecting to a lost connection, fixed
    bug that prevented keepalive pings. [SMC]
  * [extensions/keepalive.pl] keepalive now uses the proper OOB ping, instead
    of /why [JDW]
  * [extensions/gag.pl] Add '%gag topic <foo>', which will gag based on the
    content of sends instead of the sender.
  * [TLily/UI/Curses.pm,TLily/UI/Curses/StatusLine.pm,TLily/UI/Curses/Text.pm,
     extensions/ui.pl] Allow the text window to be split into multiple
     subwindows. [BEW]
  * [extensions/status.pl] If $clockseconds is set, the statusline clock
    will display seconds. [BEW]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses/StatusLine.pm] When the window's width is changed,
    redraw the status line correctly. [BEW]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses.pm] Fix for window resizing from Mike Sawyer. [DPN]
  * [extensions/autohere.pl] Added autohere, which will automatically 
    '/here' the user when they send a message.
  * [tlily.global] Set max_scrollback to 10000 by default. [DPN]
  * [extensions/on.pl] Changed %on behavior to be compatible with what
    it used to be: the default for the notify flag is now 'always'. [DPN]
  * [extensions/namethatblurb.pl] Added the amazingly silly namethatblurb
    extension, which prints the appropriate blurb when it sees "<name>'s
    blurb" in a send. [DPN]
  * [extensions/on.pl]  Added new flag to %on: 'notify (yes|no|always)',
    which marks whether %on should trigger based on the event's notify
    status (must be on, must be off, doesn't matter). [RBJ]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses/Input.pm] Bugfix: spurious ^s should no longer appear
    in the input area. [DPN]
  * [TLily/UI/*] Restructured the Curses UI into a generic "TextWindow" UI
    and a mediation layer called "FoiledAgain".  Provided a FoiledAgain 
    backends for Curses and Win32::Console, which now work identically.  [JDW]
  * Made tlily work well with a vanilla activestate [win32] perl installation,
    without additional modules or cygwin.  This will become the preferred
    way to run tlily on win32, and should be much more reliable than the
    cygwin/curses-based version. [JDW]

Version 2.3
  * [extensions/url.pl] Multiline URIs in /review, /memo and /info should be
    correctly assembled now much more than they were, though URIs that end
    exactly at the end of the line now will be wrong.  Since they are
    pretty rare compared to wrapped URIs, it seemed a fair trade-off. [DCL]
  * [extensions/ui.pl] kill-sentence, as in Emacs, bound to M-k. [DCL]
  * [extensions/ui.pl] zap-to-char, as in Emacs, bound to M-z. [DCL]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses.pm,extensions/leet.pl,extensions/paste.pl,
    extensions/ui.pl] Now you *can* have your multiline paste leet'd,
    but if you do we will find you and kill you.  Key command intercepts
    are now a list internally rather than a single item, so various
    modes are not mutually exclusive. [DCL]
  * [extensions/leet.pl,extensions/paste.pl,extensions/ui.pl] leet-mode,
    paste-mode and input-search-mode all ignored the return value of
    intercept_u, so they didn't detect failure to enter their mode because
    of already being in another mode.  (You can't have your multiline paste
    leet'd.  Oh darn.) [DCL]
  * [extensions/keepalive.pl] keepalive will now try to keep all connected
    servers alive, not just the one focused when the interval expires. [DCL]
  * [TLily/Server/SLCP.pm] During startup, some server output would be
    inadvertently lost because a text event handler was stopping processing of
    all text that did not match what it was looking for. [DCL]
  * [Makefile.PL] Detect the presence of Curses or Tk support at build time
    to determine which UIs to include, or fail if neither Curses nor Tk is
    available. [DCL]
  * [TLily/Event.pm] Show named event registration/reception/deregistration
    based on the setting of event_debug, which is interpreted as a regular
    expression matched against a string that is the event type followed by
    the file name the handler was established in.  For example, starting
    tlily with "-send_debug=blurbless" will cause blurbless.pl's registration
    (and subsequent call) of a 'server_connected' handler to be matched
    against the string "server_connected:during extensions/blurbless.pl". [DCL]
  * [TLily/Event.pm] Registering a named event handler from within a handler 
    could cause erroneously repeated handler execution (and perhaps not run
    some, but I haven't really thought about that possibility much).
  * [TLily/Server.pm] Show all data sent to server if send_debug is set. [DCL]
  * [extensions/startup.pl] Startup file/memo processing would send extraneous
    (harmless) empty lines to the server.  [DCL]
  * [TLily/ExoSafe.pm] Add a __FILE__ identifier to each compartment
    to make finding the source of an eval (eg, an event handler) easier. [DCL]
  * [extensions/blurbless.pl] Changed the handlers around a little so
    that a server_connected event triggers registering of the text/prompt
    handlers, allowing blurbless to work for connections beyond the first one.
  * [extensions/autoreview.pl] Don't unregister the connected_handler, so
    that autoreview will work for connections beyond the first one.
  * [extensions/multicore.pl] Add support for @SERVER/Command and 
    */Command [WJC]
  * [extensions/blurb.pl] changed config var to server_all, added support
    for %here, %away [WJC]
  * [TLily/Server/SLCP.pm, extensions/expand.pl] Fixed up a few bugs in
    multiserver expand.  Always add the @Server when expanding to a target
    which exists on multiple servers.  [DPN]
  * [tlily.PL] Use current perl when calling find_eagain.  [DPN]
  * [tlily.global] Changed default server to "rpi.lily.org".  [DPN]
  * [README] Added an example to (hopefully) clarify .cf usage. [WJC]
  * [TLily/Server.pm] Fixed error reporting on failed server connect.  [DPN]
  * [extension/after.pl] PR # 844 [WJC]
  * [extensions/set.pl] Added config var help [WJC]
  * [extensions/expand.pl] Fixed up tab-expansion to work with
    multiserver names. [DPN]
  * [TLily/Server/SLCP.pm] Added 'save_crufty_renames' knob to preserve
    the old, broken behavior on renames.  This feature is intentionally
    undocumented. [DPN]
  * [TLily/Server/SLCP.pm] When a user renamed, the entry for their old
    name was not correctly deleted.  Fixed. [DPN]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses/Text.pm] Added scrollback expiration.  There may still
    be some bugs in it; use with caution.  It is controlled by the
    'max_scrollback' variable. [RBJ]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses.pm] Fixed resize bug (PR#550).  Finally.  [RBJ]

Version 2.2
  * [everything] Updated hostnames and copyright dates. [DPN]
  * [extensions/program.pl] Fixed PR#848 & 850 (reedit & indented comments)[CWS]
  * [extensions/gag.pl] Added rudimentary support for %gag <group> [WJC]
  * [extensions/server.pl] Fixed PR#812 (error msg on invalid core) [WJC]
  * [Makefile.PL, tlily.PL, TLily/Config.pm, TLily/ExoSafe.pm, TLily/Extend.pm,
    TLily/User.pm] Changed build system; the new one has less features,
    but builds tlily as a single, movable file. [DPN]
  * [extensions/blurb.pl] Removed #@$#@ filter, added multi-server support [WJC]
  * [extensions/slcp_output.pl,extensions/ui.pl,tlily.global]  Add new
    styles to tag server names in pub,priv,emote messages. [RBJ]
  * [extensions/stripper.pl] Strip leading spaces from input sent to server.
  * [extensions/source.pl] You can source memos now. [WJC]
  * [extensions/url.pl] Add regex support to %url show; '%url show <regex>'
    will now show the last URL matching the regex. [RBJ]
  * [extensions/blurb.pl] New extension, auto-blurb-compression [WJC]
  * [extensions/http_parse.pl] Merged changes from http2_parse back in [WJC]
  * [extensions/http2_parse.pl] Deleted, merged back into http_parse [WJC]
  * [TLily/Server/HTTP.pm] bugfix + addition of callback, used by the 
    http2 "protocol" [WJC]
  * [extensions/http2_parse.pl] Added another httpd parsing mechanism 
    that stores the web page in memory rather than dumping it to a file. [WJC]
  * [extensions/pinhead.pl] Updated tlily1.x print call [WJC]
  * [extensions/gag.pl] Updated tlily1.x print call [WJC]
  * [extensions/misc.pl] New config vars to help suppress output [WJC]
  * [extensions/after.pl] Added support for multi-line commands [WJC]
  * [extensions/keepalive.pl] Added help for vars. [WJC]
  * [extensions/stock.pl] Rewrite, removed dep on 'wget', uses config vars 
    now [WJC]
  * [extensions/xmms.pl] Fixes, added ability to play a URL. [MJR]
  * [extensions/xmms.pl] New extension; allows user to control Xmms from
    within tlily. [WJC]
  * [TLily/User.pm] Fixed so that the POD indexer only looks at files ending
    in .pl, .pm, or .pod. [MJR]
  * [extensions] Added POD docs to more extensions. [MJR]
  * [UI/Tk] Added dump_to_file method for %dumpscrollback. [CWS]
  * [UI] Added %dumpscrollback, which lets you dump the scrollback buffer to 
    a file. [JDW]
  * [tlily.PL, extensions/on.pl] Changed the formatting of SLCP sends to
    allow event attributes to modify presentation.  [RBJ]
  * [extensions/slcp_output.pl] Changed the formatting of sends to allow
    event attributes to modify presentation.  [DPN]
  * [extensions/on.pl] Added the ability to set event attributes from a
    %on handler.  [DPN]
  * [tlily.global, extensions/blurbless.pl] New extension.  If
    $config{enter_blurbless} is true, automatically bypass the "please
    enter a blurb" prompt with no blurb. [DCL]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses/Text.pm] Default pager value for text widget set based
    on $config{page}. [DCL]
  * [extensions/keepalive.pl] Changing $config{keepalive_interval}
    after keepalive is loaded now affects the working interval. [DCL]
  * [tlily.global, TLily/UI/Curses.pm, extensions/ui.pl] New function,
    mark_output, by default bound to M-m.  Used to print a blank line to the
    screen, so you can mark where you have read up to. [DCL]
  * [extensions/ui.pl, TLiLy/UI/Curses/Input.pm] Include the current input
    line in an isearch.   Save the prefix string before searching.
    Also fixed a bug where the entered line was being appended to history
    even when it was identical to the previous line.  The code was clearly
    trying to avoid this but had an off-by-one error. [DCL]
  * [TLiLy/UI/Curses/Input.pm] previous_history and next_history could
    cause the history to become permanently edited.  New function
    save_history_excursion retains copy of the original history entry,
    which is restored by accept_line. [DCL]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses.pm] $config{scroll_to_bottom_on_input}, like xterm. [DCL]
  * [extensions/ui.pl, TLiLy/UI/Curses/Input.pm] Mucho hacking on the
    search mechanism.  toggle-input-search-mode is now isearch-backward,
    and isearch-forward was added.  Typing a key bound to backward-delete-char
    while in input_search_mode will just erase the last character of the search
    instead of terminating input_search_mode. C-r/C-s will look for the next
    match in the same direction, or will switch directions.  If the
    current search string is empty when C-r/C-s would cause a search
    for the next match, the last search is recalled.   Typing C-g will
    quit searching and return everything to the state it was in before
    searching started.  C-l will refresh the screen without exiting.  Any
    other special character exits input_search_mode, as was true before, but
    now the history position is set based on where search stopped. Can now
    search for the string "0"; could not before.  Case folded searching works,
    configurable with $config{case_fold_search}. [DCL]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses/Input.pm] Even when the input string is empty,
    accept_line now resets history position to the end, like shells do. [DCL]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses/Input.pm] Fixed a bug in search_history where the
    search was done as regexp search but the setting of point was done
    as a literal search. [DCL]
  * [extensions/ui.pl] Fixed bug in input_search_mode where the search
    string would not build on the current text region if more
    characters matched. [DCL]
  * [TLily/Event.pm] Reordered the dispatching of events so that timed
    handlers are processed before named hanflers.  This fixes the problem
    of named events sent by timed handlers having to wait for the select
    loop to timeout. [CWS]
  * [TLily/Extend.pm] In load(), when testing to see if the argument
    is an existing file, insist that a "/" be present in the name, to
    prevent from accidentally loading a file from the directory that
    tlily was started in if it happens to have the same name as an
    extension.  To explicitly load a file from the current directory,
    prepend it with "./". [DCL]
  * [TLily/UI.pm, README] Use $config{bindings} in inherit_global_bindings,
    in addition to %gbind. [DCL]
  * [extensions/source.pl, extensions/startup.pl] '#' is now a comment
    character when it starts a line. [DCL]
  * [extensions/url.pl] Do not bound urls with <url>...</url>. [DCL]
  * [TLily/Server/SLCP.pm] Don't try to use $ui->print when reporting
    an error with export if $ui is not defined. [DCL]
  * [TLily/UI.pm, TLily/UI/Curses.pm, extensions/ui.pl] %bind with
    one argument will print the binding for the key, and with no
    arguments will print all of the bindings. [DCL]
  * [TLily/Server/Event.pm] Configurable event_timeout. [DCL]
  * [extensions/url.pl] Capture URLs in text events (but still needs a
    little work to figure out wrapped URLs).  Length of default list
    configurable via $config{url_list_count}.  Format of list
    configurable via $config{url_list_format}. [DCL]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses.pm, TLily/UI/Curses/Input.pm] backward-sentence,
    forward-sentence, capitalize-word, down-case-word, up-case-word
    tranpose-words and quoted insert (the last has a few problems with
    display, but still has utility).  The sentence commands use the boolean
    $config{doublespace_period} (default: 0) to determine whether the
    end of a sentence should have two spaces.  The word commands use
    $config{word_characters} (string, default "") to determine what
    sort of characters besides alphanumerics are word characters. [DCL]
  * [extensions/startup.pl] Set no_startup_memo on the command line to not
    attempt to find a lilyStartup memo at the server. [DCL]
  * [extensions/slcp_parse.pl] Added support for queueing %NOTIFY events
    before the initial SLCP sync.  (No more "> #1739 kills Kazrak.") [SMC]
  * extended %on to support variable expansion, unregistering and listing
    handlers, and regexp matching. [JDW]

Version 2.1.1
  * Bugfix release - Release 2.1 had several old files that should have
    been included.

Version 2.1
  * [TLily/UI/{Curses,Tk}.pm] Enable/disable output based on
    $config{quiet}. [CWS]
  * [extensions/status.pl] changed the clock format to remove the
    leading 0. [CWS]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses/Input.pm, extensions/ui.pl]  Added input history
    searching!  [MJR]
  * [TLily/UI/Curses.pm] Changed the key bindings for scroll up/down.
    M-[ was a pretty bone-headed choice on my part.
    They're now M-, & M-. [MJR]
  * [extensions/status.pl] Made the statusline clearly indicate when not
    connected to any servers. [MJR]
  * [extensions/info.pl] Added lily help editing [MJR]
  * [TLily/UI/Tk.pm] First shot at a Tk UI. [CWS]
  * [various] Fixed bug in columnize_list, converted program.pl and
    spellcheck.pl to use it.
  * [various] Changed calls to old cmd_process to the new per-server one.
    removed Command.pm. [JDW]
  * [TLily/Config.pm] Removed old debugging print. [CWS]
  * [tlily.PL] Made loading of TLily::Bot dependent on $config{bot}. [CWS]
  * [TLily/Bot.pm] Fixed the import method to not pass the class name. [CWS]
  * [various] Added more of the multiserver stuff, especially the addition
    of TLily::Server::find() and TLily::Server::active(), and the complete
    change in behavior of TLily::Server::name().  Also moved columnize_list
    into TLily::Utils.  Major hacking on program.pl. [MJR]
  * [TLily/Utils.pm] New file to hold common functions, like edit_text
    and diff_text. [MJR]
  * [TLily/Server/SLCP.pm] Added mutli-server aware cmd_process.  May
    eventually remove TLily/Command.pm [MJR]
  * [extensions/slcp_parse.pl] TLily looked for %SLCP-SYNC anywhere
    in a line, not just at the beginning.  Fixed.  [MJR]
  * Extended TLily::Server::SLCP::fetch() to also fetch verbs, and
    added program.pl with verb editing [MJR]
  * Fixed the client-name-and-version-not-set problem. [CWS]
  * [TLily/Event.pm] Hopefully fixed the lost-handler bug. [CWS]
  * [TLily/Daemon/HTTP.pm]
  * [extensions/http_parse.pl] Stopped http_parse from opening a socket
    on load. [SMC]
  * [extensions/ctc.pl] Added %ctc start and %ctc stop commands, ctc
    module will not start daemon on load. [SMC]
  * [tlily.global] Added ctc.pl and http_parse.pl to @load [SMC]
	
Version 2.0
  * Added %memo. [DPN]
  * Added GPL. [CWS, JDW]
  * New install w/ Makefile.PL (removed Build.PL) [CWS]

  * spellchecker [JDW]
  * Re-integration of various things.. [JDW]
  * New UI code, event queue code, and tons of other changes [DPN]
  * SLCP, beginnings of multiserver.  Server object. [JDW]
  * Radical changes so mind-numbingly profound that they will blow your mind.
    [ALL]

Version 1.0.4-post
  * [extensions/parse.pl] Bugfix for /who output and names with spaces.  [DPN]

Version 1.0.4
  * [extensions/parse.pl] Parser fixes to cope with the changed lily output
    format for /who.  This should hopefully work on all servers -- it
    autodetects based on the /who headers.  [DPN]
  * [extensions/keepalive.pl] Changes to keepalive: I think it should actually
    work now.  [DPN]

Version 1.0.3
  * [Build.PL] Remove lilybot on a 'perl Build.PL clean'
  * [LC/CTerminal.pm] Changed the 'use POSIX' line to only include the one
    function that I know of that we use(iscntrl). [CWS]
  * [Build.PL] Modified to install the UI directory and modules. [CWS]
  * [LC/Httpd.pm, extensions/httpd.pl] Http daemon using tlily internals.
    Second stage in client-to-client communications [SMC]
  * [extensions/parse.pl, LC/User.pm] First-cut attempt at handling emotes
    as sends.  (Enabling URL parsing in emote discs.)  [DPN]
  * [LC/SubClient.pm] Changed use of IO::Select to ui_select() so we don't
    get any strange interactions between the two. [SMC]
  * [LC/Bot.pm] Created, separating out the generic bot code from lilybot.PL.

Version 1.0.2
  * [LC/UI/Native.pm] Don't replace the killbuffer with a zero-length
    string.  (i.e., ^U when point is at the start of line shouldn't
    update the killbuffer.)  [DPN]
  * [extensions/url.pl] Made "view" a synonym for "show".  [DPN]
  * [LC/UI/Native.pm] Fixed a bug which caused C-w to stop working.  [DPN]
  * [extensions/httpd.pl] Simple http daemon, the first stage in my
    client-to-client communications project. [SMC]
  * [LC/Extend.pm] Fixed Extend.pm again so that it exports the
    extension_unload() function for use by extensions. [MJR]
  * [LC/StatusLine.pm] Fixed a bug where if the system time got set
    back, the statusline would not update until the time caught back
    to where it was before. [MJR]
  * [LC/UI] Added ui.pl extension and other infrastructure.  We now have fully
    functional multi-window support in tlily!
  * [LC/UI/OutputWindow]  Created a new UI module.  Sort of a "status window"
    at this point.
  * [LC/UI] Major overhaul of UI subsystem.  Created LC::UI:: modules for each
    UI.  Also created a LC::UI::SSFE module as an example.
  * [extensions/url.pl] Bugfix: Netscape doesn't like commas in arguments
    to openURL, so replace them with %2c.  [DPN]
  * [extensions/program.pl] Preliminary version of an extension for 
    to enable server maintenance.  This version contains a very hackish
    verb editor. [MJR]
  * [LC/Extend] Modified to gracefully handle errors during extension
    loading. [MJR]
  * [extensions/url.pl] Cleaned up handling of URLs ending in punctuation.
  * [extensions/url.pl] Added "tag_urls" config option to specify the
    URL number of each captured URL.  Added support for "%url ##" where
    ## <= 0; this shows URLs off the bottom of the list.  [DPN]
  * [tlily.global] Added examples for autoreview.  [DPN]
  * [extensions/autoreview.pl] Added the 'autoreview' extension.  [DPN]
  * [extensions/pipes.pl] Create temp files with mode 0600, and delete them
    when finished with them.  [DPN]

Version 1.0.1
  * [extensions/parse.pl] Possible fix for an obscure parser bug.  [DPN]
  * [extensions/view.pl, extensions/log.pl] IO::File bug fix [MJR]

    didn't work right -- yanked it out to a full if() stmt [CWS]

Version 0.5a
  * [Build.PL] Bugfix:  The perl library 'use lib (...' line shouldn't have
    the trailing "/LC" on it [CWS]

  * [extensions/zone.pl] If $zonetype is set to 12, timestamps will be
    displayed in a 12 hour clock. [CWS]
  * [LC/StatusLine.pm] If $clocktype is set to 12, the statusline clock will
    be displayed in a 12 hour clock. [CWS]

    zonedelta-ed similar to what the zone module does for timestamps. [CWS]
  * Autologin.  [DPN]

    extension search path will be used.  [DPN]

  * Meta keys now function.  [DPN]

  * [tlily.PL] Played with login stuff so client options are sent at the
    blurb prompt and, therefore, we get the %connected option at RPI. [CWS]
  * [LC/Event.pm] Fixed documentation;  dispatch_event takes 1 arg, a
    hashref. [CWS]
  * [extensions/look.pl] Look extension: perform a look(1) on the word under
    the cursor.  [DPN]

    when /oops-ing or /also-ing; enabled with $config{oops} and $config{also};
    when set to "/", intercepts /oops and /also, when set to "%", adds
    commands %oops and %also, when set to "/%" or "%/", does both. [CWS]
  * [tlily.PL] Commented out some unused variables and fixed some typos to
    make perl -w happier. [CWS]
  * The parser should now catch sends from the user.  (<< and <-)  [DPN]

  * Minor UI bugfix involving the input line's attributes.  [DPN]
  * The Build script will now cache whether the directories in the cache
    file are for the local directory, and warn you not to do an install. [CWS]
  * If you try to install while your cached directories are for the local
    directory, the Build script asks you if you really want to install. [CWS]
  * The Build script explains better about the module library directory
    (that you shouldn't add the trailing /LC) when asking for it. [CWS]

Version 0.3a
  * Build script now asks what paths you want to use and caches them,
    rather than making you edit Build.PL to set them.
  * Build script makes all generated files read-only to discourage editing.

  * user-entered text now has an attribute 
  * timezone rewriting added 


Version 0.1c
  * Silly me. I made a foolish error when merging Josh's info patch. Fixed. 
  * /info set now works for discussions. Really. 


Version 0.1b
  * /info set now works for discussions. 
  * Private messages to multiple destinations are parsed correctly. 
  * C-d deletes the character following the cursor. 
  * Turning your blurb off is noticed.
