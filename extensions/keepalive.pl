'The keepalive extension is useful for maintaining a connection to the
server on links which drop after a period of inactivity.  (Such as when
sitting behind a firewall doing NAT.)  Keepalive will send a "/why" to
the server every few minutes.  There are two configuration variables:

    $keepalive_interval - Specifies the frequency (in seconds) to send pings.
    $keepalive_debug    - Set this to be notified when a ping is sent.

In addition, you may modify the keepalive interval with the %keepalive
command.');
